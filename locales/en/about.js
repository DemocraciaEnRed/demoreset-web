  alt: 'Deliberative democracy',
  content1: 'In collaboration with the global office of the National Endowment for Democracy NED and the Extituto de Politica Abierta (Colombia), we brought together 100 organizations from the Global South, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia and Latin America to restore our democracies.',
  content2: 'In this project, initiatives will be incorporated to participate in an experience that will <b>transform the landscape of democracy in the Global South.</b> From this space, you will be able to find tools and solutions from around the world to address the challenges that organizations like yours face in the process of deploying democratic innovation. You will have a network of organizations in 4 regions of the Global South, who will share their best practices and with whom you will be able to build alliances, spaces to develop and refine your proposals for change in a Global South Summit. You will be able to implement a tool/solution in your specific region with specialized support, international mentoring, among other surprises.',
